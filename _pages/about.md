## Welcome

I am a PhD student in Physics at Rutgers University, where I work on theoretical physics research under the supervision of Prof. Greg Moore and Prof. Heeyeon Kim. My research focuses on supersymmetric gauge theories, string theory, conformal field theory, and vertex operator algebras.

## Research Interests

**Supersymmetric Gauge Theories**: K-theoretic Donaldson invariants, 
superconformal index, representation theory of knots, N=(0,2) Landau-Ginzburg models
**Conformal Field Theory**: Non-chiral vertex operator algebras (VOA), and modular tensor categories
**Applied Computing**: Distributed systems for machine learning, efficient large language model inference, graph neural networks
