## Welcome

I am a PhD student in Physics at Rutgers University, where I work on theoretical physics research under the supervision of Prof. Greg Moore and Prof. Heeyeon Kim. My research focuses on supersymmetric gauge theories, string theory, conformal field theory, and vertex operator algebras.

## Research Interests

- **Theoretical Physics**: Supersymmetric gauge theories, string theory, and mathematical physics
- **Conformal Field Theory**: Non-chiral CFT, vertex operator algebras, and modular tensor categories  
- **Mathematical Physics**: K-theoretic Donaldson invariants, representation theory of knots
- **Applied Research**: Distributed systems for machine learning, efficient computing for large models
