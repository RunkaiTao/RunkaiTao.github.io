## Lecture Notes

### Theoretical Physics

**Modular Tensor Categories and Rational Conformal Field Theory**  
*Co-authored with Ranveer Kumar Singh, Madhav Sinha, and F.S. Stubbs*  
*Work in progress*  
We discuss modular tensor categories (MTC) and the formulation of rational conformal field theory (RCFT) as an MTC. We explicitly check the construction for the Ising CFT.

*Co-authored with Satoshi Nawata and Daisuke Yokoyama*  
*Published: August 2022*  
Comprehensive lecture notes covering the fundamentals of two-dimensional conformal field theory, including symmetries, correlation functions, and applications to string theory.
