As we begin 2025, I wanted to share an update on some exciting developments in my research, particularly our ongoing work on K-theoretic Donaldson invariants.

## Current Project: Path Integral Approach

Over the past few months, I've been collaborating with Prof. Heeyeon Kim, Jan Manschot, Prof. Gregory Moore, and Xinyu Zhang on developing path integral derivations of K-theoretic Donaldson invariants. This work builds on the rich mathematical structure connecting gauge theory, topology, and algebraic geometry.

### Key Progress

**Mathematical Framework**: We've made significant progress in establishing the mathematical foundations for our path integral approach. The K-theoretic version of Donaldson invariants provides a natural generalization that connects to modern developments in both mathematics and physics.

**Computational Techniques**: Developing effective computational methods has been a major focus. The path integral formulation offers new perspectives on calculations that were previously quite challenging.

**Physical Interpretation**: One of the most exciting aspects has been uncovering the physical meaning behind the mathematical structures we're studying.

## Broader Research Context

This work fits into the larger picture of my research on supersymmetric gauge theories and their mathematical applications. The connections between:

- Supersymmetric gauge theories
- Topological field theories  
- Geometric invariants
- K-theory

continue to reveal deep and unexpected relationships.

## Applied Computing Work

Parallel to my theoretical physics research, my internships have provided valuable experience in applied computing:

**At Georgia Tech**: Working on distributed systems for graph neural networks has given me new perspectives on scalability and efficiency in computational systems.

**Upcoming at Amazon AWS**: I'm looking forward to applying these insights to large language model optimization and deployment challenges.

## Looking Ahead

The intersection of theoretical physics and computational methods continues to be a source of inspiration. Whether it's developing new mathematical techniques for gauge theory calculations or optimizing distributed computing systems, the underlying principles of efficiency, elegance, and scalability remain central.

I'm excited to see where these parallel tracks of research lead, and how insights from one area continue to inform the other.
