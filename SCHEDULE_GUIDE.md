# Daily Schedule Management Guide

This guide explains how to create and manage your personal daily schedule using the hidden schedule system.

## üìç Accessing Your Schedule

Your daily schedule is hidden from public view but accessible at:
**URL: `yoursite.com/schedule/`**

This page won't appear in navigation or blog listings - only accessible via direct URL.

## üìÖ How the Schedule System Works

### 1. Data Structure
Your schedule data is stored in `_data/schedule.yml` with two types of schedules:

- **Specific Dates**: Exact schedules for particular days
- **Recurring Patterns**: Default weekly patterns that apply when no specific date is set

### 2. Schedule Priority
The system follows this priority:
1. **Specific date schedule** (if exists) ‚Üí Shows custom schedule for that day
2. **Recurring weekly pattern** ‚Üí Shows default pattern for that day of week
3. **No schedule** ‚Üí Shows empty day

## üõ†Ô∏è Creating Your Schedules

### Adding a Specific Day Schedule

Edit `_data/schedule.yml` and add under the `schedules:` section:

```yaml
schedules:
  "2025-08-21":  # Format: YYYY-MM-DD
    - time: "09:00"           # Start time (24-hour format)
      duration: 90            # Duration in minutes
      activity: "Research Session"
      category: "research"    # Category for color coding
      location: "Office"      # Optional: where the activity takes place
      notes: "Focus on string theory calculations"  # Optional: additional notes
    
    - time: "11:00"
      duration: 30
      activity: "Coffee Break"
      category: "break"
      location: "Caf√©"
    
    - time: "14:00"
      duration: 120
      activity: "Team Meeting"
      category: "meeting"
      location: "Conference Room"
      notes: "Weekly progress review"
```

### Setting Up Weekly Recurring Patterns

For days that follow a regular pattern, add under `recurring:`:

```yaml
recurring:
  monday:
    - time: "09:00"
      duration: 180
      activity: "Deep Work Block"
      category: "research"
      location: "Office"
      notes: "Most productive time for complex problems"
    
    - time: "14:00"
      duration: 60
      activity: "Administrative Tasks"
      category: "admin"
      location: "Office"
  
  tuesday:
    - time: "10:00"
      duration: 120
      activity: "Teaching Preparation"
      category: "teaching"
      location: "Office"
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Schedule Not Showing?
1. Check date format: Use `"YYYY-MM-DD"` format
2. Verify YAML syntax: Proper indentation and structure
3. Check category exists: Use predefined categories or add new ones

### Times Not Displaying Correctly?
1. Use 24-hour format: `"09:00"` not `"9:00 AM"`
2. Include quotes: Always quote time strings
3. Check duration: Ensure it's a number (not quoted)

### Jekyll Build Errors?
1. Validate YAML: Use a YAML validator to check syntax
2. Check file encoding: Ensure UTF-8 encoding
3. Restart Jekyll: After major changes, restart the server
